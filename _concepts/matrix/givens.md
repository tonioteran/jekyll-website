## Motivation

As outlined in {% cite kaess2008isam }, a standard approach to incrementally obtain the QR factorization of a matrix is to employ *Givens rotations* of the form

$$
\begin{equation}
\boldsymbol{\Phi} = \begin{bmatrix} \cos{\phi} & \sin{\phi} \\ -\sin{\phi} & \cos{\phi} \end{bmatrix},
\end{equation}
$$

to eliminate the $(i,j)$ entry, with $i > k$.

Here's a simple, step-by-step example:
